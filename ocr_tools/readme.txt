Before using the script, you need to have python 3.8(and above) working environment.

0. before using the bot, make sure you have all your clients' character sheet openend and placed to the left-top corner

1. write down 'skillname leveltoadd'  in skills.txt
-make sure every line only has one 'skillname leveltoadd'!!!
-remember to save the file!!!
-make sure you type in skills that are less than 24 hours first!!!
-Ex: adding skill gunnery to level 4(currently lv2), type in 'Gunnery 2' in skills.txt

2. open up all clients you want to add skill on, no need to sign in
-remember the numbers of actual running clients(and make sure they matched the accounts you opened, sometimes clients dont show up although they are running)
-KEEP YOUR CLIENT WINDOWS AT DEFAULT AND DONT MOVE THEM
-open bot.py in IDLE, run module,
-type in farm(n) to begin, n is the numbers of your running clients.
